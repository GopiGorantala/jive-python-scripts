Python scripts to perform several admin tasks on jive via jive rest apis

As a Jive developer and admin, I have to perform several tasks to debug issues on our internal jive instance, or run spikes to test rest apis for a jive app to be developed.
I love python and so end up writing a scripts to perform actions on jive using rest apis.

I have tried to put some of those random scripts in this repo and will keep updating.

I have done some random refactoring on the script before checkin as some of these were writen an year back.
So if they give an error, do let me know. Coz I have not tested every refactored method in the code, but the concept behind each action is still valid.

Feel free to use these to understand jive rest apis and debug jive issues on your instance.
