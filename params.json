Coz I have not tested every refactored method while checkin, but have run it sometime back on our prod instance. The concept behind each action is still valid.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use these to understand jive rest apis and debug jive issues on your instance.\r\n\r\n**Scripts contain following Jive actions:**\r\n\r\n* Endorse expertise for a user\r\n* Associate a group with user's stream (follow group)\r\n* Add user as member to a group\r\n* Force users to follow a group in email watches stream (if present. this was for our custom streamonce)\r\n* Get group followers\r\n* Get group members\r\n* Delete membership\r\n* Check streams and receive emails status of each stream of a user\r\n* Create a new stream for user\r\n* Get all jive system properties\r\n* Create jive system properties\r\n* Destroy jive system properties\r\n* Get all groups on jive instance\r\n* Get all private and secret groups\r\n* remove all users from a group\r\n* Get user photos / avatars\r\n* Download all content of a group in pdf format\r\n* Get groups owned by a user\r\n* Send direct message\r\n* Run-as-feature\r\n \r\nThough jive cloud admin console does not have system property view, the above mentioned action related to system properties work via jive rest API on cloud too\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
